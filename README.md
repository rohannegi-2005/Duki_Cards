# 🃏 Cards Game (DUKI)

This project brings to life a **classic card game** I used to play with my friends during holidays.  
While we had a great time playing it in person, distance made it tough once everyone returned to their colleges and jobs.  
So, I decided to take the game **online** — now we can play it from **anywhere, anytime!** 🌍
