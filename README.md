Cards Game (DUKI)

>> This project brings to life a classic card game that I used to play with my friends during holidays. While we had a great time playing it together in person, distance made it difficult once everyone returned to their colleges and jobs. So I decided to take the game online — and now we can play it from anywhere, anytime.
